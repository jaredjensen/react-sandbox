# react-sandbox

Playground for me to practice using React and configure a build environment while learning.  Initially based on the [React.js: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started/table-of-contents) series on Pluralsight.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `gulp`

Changes to source files are watched and transpiled with Babel to ES2015.  A local web server with liveReload is used to render the site.
